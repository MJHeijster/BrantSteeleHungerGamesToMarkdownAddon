This extension allows the extraction of the results of the Hunger Games simulation on https://brantsteele.net/hungergames. After agreeing and starting the simulation, you can right click and select "Brand Steele's battle royale to markdown" on any result page to get a markdown text in your clipboard. This can easily be used on Discord.
